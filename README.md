### PHISHING URLS DETECTING USING RANDOM FOREST MODEL ###

The model is trained and built via Google Colab.
Required libraries are imported and the model is loaded from the saved model file.
The model is then used to predict whether a given URL is a phishing URL or not.
The model's performance is evaluated using the accuracy score.

In the future, this model will be applied to an extension for Google Chrome to detect phishing URLs in real-time.
